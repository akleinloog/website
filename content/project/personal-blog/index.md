The goal of this project was to set up a simple website to use as a personal blog.
You are currently looking at the result of this!

## The What

The basic idea was to set up a blog where I can easily manage my posts and provide some info on myself and the projects I work on.
Having played around with Wordpress in the past, I wanted something different this time.

My main requirements:
* Easy to use (for me)
* Easy to host
* Free of costs (no licence or hosting fees)
* Learn something new in the process


## The Why

My main motivation is to have a place to keep track of the many technical experiments I do and their outcomes.
A blog that allows me to write small posts, tag them, and easily search through them seemed like a good solution.

If others can also find these experiments and learn from them, that would be an additional benefit. And if they in turn can provide feedback, even better.

## The How

After looking around a bit I decided to try out the following:
* Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Static Site Generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Write the content in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* Use a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akleinloog/website) to keep the sources
* Use another [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akleinloog/akleinloog.github.io) to host the resulting blog
* Open Source the result so others might learn from it

## The Results

The current state of this project is open for all to see. Look around and take a look at the sources if you are interested.

This is still a work in progress, I will add some posts that detail what I did and what I used, and hope to add some additional features soon, for example, the possibility for others to comment.

I hope you will find this useful somehow!
