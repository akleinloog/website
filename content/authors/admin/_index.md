Currently working as a Software Architect in a team focused on Digital Health Solutions at Roche Diagnostics, I am passionate about all things related to software architecture and software engineering. Even more so when it comes to Cloud Native Software, a world that I have just started to explore. 

I believe that Cloud Native Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) has the potential to make advances in healthcare technology accessible to patients and medical professionals worldwide, and am looking forward to make my contribution towards unlocking this potential.

To be clear, all opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the position of Roche or any of Roche's affiliates.
