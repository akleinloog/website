Currently working as a software architect in a team focused on digital health solutions at Roche Diagnostics, I am passionate about all things related to software architecture and software engineering. Even more so when it comes to combining software as a medical device (SaMD) with cloud native technologies. 

I believe that cloud native SaMDs have the potential to make advances in healthcare technology accessible to patients and medical professionals worldwide, and enjoy making my contribution towards unlocking this potential.

Just to be clear, all opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the position of Roche or any of Roche's affiliates.
