# My Blog

This repository contains the sources for my personal blog. To see it in action, visit [https://www.kleinloog.ch](https://www.kleinloog.ch).

The blog is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as editor.
The resulting website is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

For more info, see the project description [here](https://www.kleinloog.ch/project/personal-blog/).
